# Photon-counting CT thermometry via material decomposition and machine learning

Code underlying the results of the above paper (to appear in Springer Visual Computing for Industry, Biomedicine, and Art)

## Key result
A fully connected neural network trained to predict temperature from spectrally-resolved attenuation values of a set of basis materials (water, 50 mM CaCl2, 600 mM CaCl2) generalizes well to other materials (300 mM CaCl2 and a protein shake).
